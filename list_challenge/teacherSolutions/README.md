# 🏫 Teacher Solutions - List Challenge

This folder contains complete solutions for all 6 levels of the List Challenge. Use these to check student work, demonstrate correct implementations, or show during class.

## Files

- `list_level_1_solution.py` - Creating and accessing lists
- `list_level_2_solution.py` - Adding, modifying, and removing items
- `list_level_3_solution.py` - Looping through lists and calculations
- `list_level_4_solution.py` - Searching, finding, and conditional logic
- `list_level_5_solution.py` - Transforming and converting list items
- `list_level_6_solution.py` - Sorting, combining, and filtering lists

## How to Use

### Option 1: Quick Reference
Open a solution file to see how the challenge should be completed. Compare it with student code to identify what they did correctly or what needs adjustment.

### Option 2: Live Demo
Run a solution file during class to demonstrate how the code should work:
```bash
python list_level_1_solution.py
```

### Option 3: Show-and-Tell
Display the solution on screen to walk through the concept after students have attempted it.

## Key Concepts Covered

**Level 1:** List creation, indexing (0-based)
**Level 2:** `.append()`, `.pop()`, item modification
**Level 3:** `for` loops, aggregation (sum/average)
**Level 4:** `in` operator, `.index()`, `.count()`, conditional checks
**Level 5:** Loop-based transformations, creating new lists
**Level 6:** `.sort()`, list concatenation (+), filtering

## Tips for Instruction

1. **After students attempt Level X**, run the solution to show what they should have achieved
2. **Highlight different approaches** - these solutions show one valid approach, but there are often multiple ways to solve the same problem
3. **Pause and discuss** - Point out specific lines and ask why that code works
4. **Spot common mistakes** - Use solutions to show what NOT to do (e.g., forgetting the loop index update)

## Alternative Solutions

Students may write code slightly differently than these solutions. For example:
- Level 3: `total += score` instead of `total = total + score`
- Level 4: Multiple `if` statements instead of `if`/`elif`/`else`
- Level 5: Using `.upper()` vs other text methods
- Level 6: List comprehensions (advanced) instead of explicit loops

All valid approaches that produce correct output should be accepted!
