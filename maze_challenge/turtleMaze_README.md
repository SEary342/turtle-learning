# 🐢 The Turtle Maze Challenge

> **Goal:** Program a turtle to navigate through different maze levels without hitting the walls.

## How to Start

1.  Open the file `maze_level_1.py` in VS Code. It's already set up for you:

    ```python
    from maze_challenge.maze_engine import move, player, setup_maze, screen

    # Setup Level 1 (Levels 1-5 available)
    setup_maze(level=1)

    # Write your code to move the turtle!
    move(100)

    # Keep the window open
    screen.mainloop()
    ```
